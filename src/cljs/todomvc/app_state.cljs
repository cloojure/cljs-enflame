; -- Spec --------------------------------------------------------------------
; This is a clojure.spec specification for the value in :app-state. It is like a
; Schema. See: http://clojure.org/guides/spec
;
; The value in :app-state should always match this spec. Only event handlers
; can change the value in :app-state so, after each event handler
; has run, we re-check :app-state for correctness (compliance with the Schema).
;
; How is this completed? Look in events.cljs and you'll notice that all handlers
; have an "after" interceptor which does the spec re-check.
;
; None of this is strictly necessary. It could be omitted. But we find it
; good practice.
(s/def ::id int?)
(s/def ::title string?)
(s/def ::completed boolean?)
(s/def ::todo (s/keys :req-un [::id ::title ::completed]))

(s/def ::todos (s/and ; should use the :kind kw to s/map-of (not supported yet)
                 (s/map-of ::id ::todo) ; in this map, each todo is keyed by its :id
                 #(instance? PersistentTreeMap %))) ; is a sorted-map (not just a map)

(s/def ::display-mode    ; what todos are shown to the user?
  #{:all            ; all todos are shown
    :active         ; only todos whose :completed is false
    :completed})         ; only todos whose :completed is true
(s/def ::app-state (s/keys :req-un [::todos ::display-mode]))

; -- Default :app-state Value  ---------------------------------------------------
; When the application first starts, this will be the value put in :app-state
; Unless, of course, there are todos in the LocalStore (see further below)
; Look in:
;   1.  `core.cljs` for  "(dispatch-sync [:initialise-state])"
;   2.  `events.cljs` for the registration of :initialise-state handler
(def default-state     ; what gets put into :app-state by default.
  {:todos   (sorted-map) ; an empty list of todos. Use the (int) :id as the key
   :display-mode :all})  ; show all todos

; -- Local Storage  ----------------------------------------------------------
; Part of the todomvc challenge is to store todos in LocalStorage, and
; on app startup, reload the todos from when the program was last run.
; But the challenge stipulates to NOT load the setting for the "showing"
; filter. Just the todos.
